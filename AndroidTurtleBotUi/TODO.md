#TODO

**TODO**
- instead of enlarging/shrinking bitmaps by a constant rate such as (x+10, y+10), take into account the ratio (i.e. enlarge by (x+width/10, y+height/10), or something similar).
- stop robot from floating away (move map with circular gesture one finger to see)

**List of gestures**
- click robot = select
- swipe (robot selected) = draw path
- swipe (robot NOT selected) = move map
- double click (robot selected) = tell robot to travel the path

- rotate two fingers clockwise/counterclockwise (robot NOT selected) = rotate map
- = zoom out
- = zoom in
